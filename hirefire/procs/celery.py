    :param app: the Celery app to check for the queues (optional)
    :type name: str
    :type queues: str or list
    :type app: :class:`~celery.Celery`

    Declarative example::

        from celery import Celery
        from hirefire.procs.celery import CeleryProc

        celery = Celery('myproject', broker='amqp://guest@localhost//')

        class WorkerProc(CeleryProc):
            name = 'worker'
            queues = ['celery']
            app = celery

    Or a simpler variant::

        worker_proc = CeleryProc('worker', queues=['celery'], app=celery)

    In case you use one of the non-standard Celery clients (e.g.
    django-celery) you can leave the ``app`` attribute empty because
    Celery will automatically find the correct Celery app::

        from hirefire.procs.celery import CeleryProc

        class WorkerProc(CeleryProc):
            name = 'worker'
            queues = ['celery']

    Querying the tasks that are on the workers is a more expensive
    process, and if you're sure that you don't need them, then you
    can improve the response time by not looking for some statuses.
    The default statuses that are looked for are ``active``,
    ``reserved``, and ``scheduled``. You can configure to *not*
    look for those by overriding the ``inspect_statuses`` property.
    For example, this proc would not look at any tasks held by
    the workers.

    ::

        class WorkerProc(CeleryProc):
            name = 'worker'
            queues = ['celery']
            inspect_statuses = []

    ``scheduled`` tasks are tasks that have been triggered with an
    ``eta``, the most common example of which is using ``retry``
    on tasks. If you're sure you aren't using these tasks, you can
    skip querying for these tasks.

    ``reserved`` tasks are tasks that have been taken from the queue
    by the main process (coordinator) on the worker dyno, but have
    not yet been given to a worker run. If you've configured Celery
    to only fetch the tasks that it is currently running, then you
    may be able to skip querying for these tasks. See
    http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/optimizing.html#prefetch-limits
    form more information.

    ``active`` tasks are currently running tasks. If your tasks are
    short-lived enough, then you may not need to look for these tasks.
    If you choose to not look at active tasks, look out for
    ``WorkerLostError`` exceptions.
    See https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/2839 for more information.
